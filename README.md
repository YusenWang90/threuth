## User interaction and how to control the program

Click the program exe to run it directly, hold down the right mouse button to rotate the viewpoint, and W S A D Q E to move the direction.

## How the program code works and classes and functions

The program defines the Camera class for roaming, the Texture class for loading textures, the ObjModel class for loading obj models, the ShaderProgram class for loading compiled shaders, and the OpenGLRenderer class for encapsulating OpenGL rendering functionality, which work together to form the basis of the program's operation.

## What makes me special and what I started with

My program uses OpenGL to create a farm-themed virtual scene that immerses the user in the serene atmosphere of a farm. Although similar applications exist, our goal was to differentiate our program by incorporating unique elements and attention to detail.

The idea for this program came from wanting to provide users with a serene and visually appealing virtual experience. We wanted to create a relaxing environment where people could escape the stresses of everyday life and enjoy the beauty of nature.

To get started, we began researching different farm landscapes and observing real farms to understand the elements that make them attractive. We then used this knowledge to design and create a variety of farm related elements such as barns, fields, trees and animals.

Our goal was to make the scene as realistic as possible, so we paid special attention to details such as the way the grass sways in the wind, the sound of birds singing, and the way the sunlight passes through the trees. These elements, combined with a selection of colors and textures, helped us create a visually pleasing experience that captured the essence of the farm.

While we didn't start with a pre-existing project, we drew on existing farm-themed virtual experiences. However, we made our project unique by adding personalized elements and incorporating small details that enhance the experience. By taking the time to perfect each aspect, we were able to create a scene that transcends mere visual simulation and inspires a sense of calm and serenity.

Overall, my program stood out for its attention to detail, realism, and ability to transport the user to a serene farm environment. By using OpenGL, it was possible to create a visually pleasing scene that captured the essence of a real farm without the need for complex interactions. The end result provides a unique and immersive experience for the user.
